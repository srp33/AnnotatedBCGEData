AnnotatedBCGEData Developer Guide
================

# Intro

The AnnotateBCGEData package relies heavily on Zenodo as its primary
data store. Zenodo’s REST API functionality has made it easy for
developers to access data in Zenodo from code. All data that is accessed
by AnnotatedBCGEData should be stored in the [Zenodo
Repository](https://zenodo.org/communities/annnotatedbcgedata/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest).
All code related to the project should be saved in the [GitHub
Repository](https://github.com/srp33/AnnotatedBCGEData). <br><br>

There are several files to be aware of when attempting to modify
AnnotatedBCGEData. The first of these files is, of course, the gene
expression data and metadata files stored in Zenodo. These are .tsv
files that can be uploaded directly by anyone given permission to the
community. Next are the ontology files. The NCIT Definitions file
contains a table of terms that are used in the ontology and their
definitions. This is searched by the searchDefs function, allowing the
user to see what terms are included in the package. The mapped ontology
file contains all the terms that are associated with each data set. It
is a table with columns for the name of the dataset, the name of the
term, its associated values, and what the terms and values are in the
original data. The next file is the dataset metadata file, which was
generated from pephub data. It contains the metadata about the GEO
accession or other database where the data came from. This is accessed
when the user calls searchForDatasets, along with the mapping file. See
below for more detailed information about the specific files. <br><br>

There is a detailed process outlined below for adding more and updating
the data in the package. There are several aspects of the package that
should be updated regularly as new versions of the data are published
and uploaded. See below for more information.

# R and Bioconductor Package Structure

R packages that are developed for public use and published on
Bioconductor are required to follow several guidelines related to
included files and general structure. If these guidelines are not met,
it can cause problems for users who already have the package downloaded,
as well as prohibit updates from being published on Bioconductor. The
following sections provide information about various file types that are
found in the general package structure and what they are for.

## Vignettes and README

The README file is automatically generated from GitHub. This file should
be a general overview of the package, but the main information will be
contained in the vignettes. The vignettes are generated from RMarkdown
files in the vignettes/ directory. The vignettes are essentially a user
guide for the package. These can be found via functions included with
Bioconductor, as well as linked on the Bioconductor page where the
package is published. A detailed vignette allows all aspects of the
package to be well understood by the users. When new functions are added
to the package, it should be reflected in the vignettes. <br><br>

The vignettes contain several fields that are necessary for proper
generation of the html document and for the code blocks to run. We ask
that future developers do not remove or tamper with these sections as it
could unknowingly break other code below. The code in the vignette is
run as one long script. Thus, a library() statement at the top of the
vignette would still affect code at the bottom. <br><br>

For changes made to the vignettes to be reflected in the html document,
the .Rmd file has to knit. This will run all blocks of code and generate
the updated version of the document. This can be viewed after the window
opens when rendering is complete.

## DESCRIPTION

The DESCRIPTION file contains the information required for the user to
set up the package, as well as some metadata related to the package. The
biocViews field contains keywords that are associated with the package.
This allows users to find the package when searching on Bioconductor.
The Suggests fields are packages that are recommended for developers who
are adding to the package. The most important field is imports, which
are the packages that the actual code depends on. These are packages
that must be installed to run the package. These include packages that
are necessary for the vignette to run.

## NAMESPACE and man

The NAMESPACE file contains all the imports and exports for the package.
Functions and objects that are accessible by the user must be exported
and written to the NAMESPACE file. Along with the imports section of
DESCRIPTION, the imports used in the actual code will be recorded in the
NAMESPACE. This file cannot be edited by hand. To edit the file, add
roxygen2 notation above the functions or files that you want to
document. See R/ directory for examples. <br> The functions and objects
that are exported by the package will have a .Rd file associated with
them. This file will be saved to the man directory, where the package
will look for the exported functions when it is loaded on the user’s
machine. The man directory also contains plots and images that are
created for the vignettes. These files are also not edited by hand.
These are generated from roxygen2 notation and subsequently running
devtools::document().

## .Rbuildignore and .gitignore

The .Rbuildignore contains files that should be excluded from the
package when it is built on the user’s machine. This includes our
devdocs/ directory since it is specific to developers, for example. Any
files that are not needed for the user to access the package should be
included in .Rbuildignore. <br> The .gitignore contains files that
should not be pushed to GitHub but are contained in the package. This
includes the .Rproj files since this file is intended to establish a
workspace as an R project, and should not be pushed to GitHub. Any files
that are too big and not necessary to be saved within the package
structure should also not be pushed to GitHub. If the files are needed
by other developers, they should be uploaded to Zenodo.

## R

The R/ directory contains all R code that is used to make the package.
This includes helpers, exported functions, and any kind of classes that
were created. All code in this directory should have roxygen2
documentation at the top to specify the imports and exports. All code
included is necessary for building the package. Code that was written to
edit other files should be in the devdocs/ directory, like
datameta_pephub.R and ontology_xl_edit.py. This code was used to
generate the dataset metadata and the edited mapping ontology, which
were uploaded to Zenodo.

# Ontology

An ontology is a set of terms that are associated with each other within
a specific field. In our case, these are terms related to breast cancer
and how they relate to the data. This can include Estrogen Receptor
Status or Patient Age. Defining these terms and allowing the user to
access them through the package lets them filter datasets based on
properties they are interested in. We collected the terms in the
ontology from the metadata collected by the researchers. Thus, each
dataset is associated with the ontology that the researchers collected.
If researchers recorded Estrogen Receptor Status in the sample metadata,
then the term was mapped to that dataset along with the values they
recorded.

## NCIT Definitions

All ontology terms and values included in this package came from the
[National Cancer Institute
Thesaurus](https://evsexplore.semantics.cancer.gov/evsexplore/welcome).
These are the official definitions of all the terms included. If terms
are added, their definitions should come from this website. This ensures
the most correct definition according to other researchers and doctors
in the field. The NCIT definitions file contains the URI, the term name,
a definition of the term, and the NCIT code that is associated with the
term. The users are able to search this table by any of these fields,
and the result will be a shortened table with matching rows. From here,
the user can confirm which term is closest to the term they are
searching for, and record the code. The code can then be passed to the
function for searching the mapped ontology, which then returns related
datasets.

## Mapped Ontology

The datasets included in the package have been mapped to their
respective ontology terms. The file with the mapping data contains the
term and its code, the dataset name, the original term, the ontology
terms for the values related to the field, and the original values. The
researchers were not consistent across various studies with the how they
labeled the various data points. While one study may have labeled
Estrogen Receptor Status as “ER status”, another may have just been
“er”. Further, the values associated with the file could be “1+” or
“positive”. Thus, the values and terms had to be mapped to the terms
they related to and then put in the file. The file contains the original
values because the names of the data points were not changed in the
actual data. After the user has obtained a code for an ontology term
from searching the definitions file, they are able to pass it to another
function that returns all the datasets associated with that code. The
rows of the returned table contain the dataset name, the code, the
original values as they are found in the dataset, and some metadata
about the data. The users are then able to take the name of the desired
datasets and pass them to the function that returns the
SummarizedExperiment objects.

# Dataset Metadata

In addition to the metadata that the researchers collected, we also
gathered the metadata about the study itself. This includes information
like where the study was conducted, when, or the method used to collect
gene expression values. We decided to include this data with the mapped
ontology so that users could consider this data when choosing which
datasets they want to create objects for. In our case, the data was
collected primarily using pephub, a website that contains all metadata
from GEO. The code for creating the table with this data can be found in
make_dataset_level_meta.R in /devdocs. The code is annotated to make it
reusable.

# Adding Data to the Package

When adding new data to the package, it is important that certain steps
be followed so that users can correctly access the data. 1. First, the
data must be uploaded to Zenodo. If you do not have permission to upload
new data to the repository, reach out to the maintainer. The names of
the files are intended to be consistent with every uploaded dataset. The
expression data should be in a file GSEXXXXX.tsv.gz, and the metadata
should be in a file GSEXXXXXX_metadata.tsv. It is important that the
names and formats of the files are consistent. Both the expression data
and metadata should be uploaded in one record to the repository. See the
other datasets in the repository for examples. 2. Next, the data should
be added to the package source code. If this is not done, the data will
not be accessible by the package. The dataset needs to be an additional
like in the identifiers named list. This list is found at the bottom of
R/cache-helpers.R. It is absolutely ESSENTIAL that the following steps
be followed EXACTLY in order for the code to correctly handle the data.
The name of the dataset should match its EXACT name as found in the
original location (i.e, GSE1234). The vector in the list that contains
the identifiers should go in the following order: concept DOI,
expression data filename, metadata filename. Make sure each identifier
is entered as a string. The name of the dataset should not be a string.
